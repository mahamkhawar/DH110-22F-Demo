## Assignment 03
### Step 1 Specify the research goal & requirements 
- What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
   - The main activity this project would support would be connecting users with sustainability projects in their local area so they can help out with a cause they support.
- What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
  - This activity fills the need for wanting to develop the community for the user. It also feels the need of satisfaction from volunteering or giving back to their community. Users are able to feel a sense of an accomplishment and overlal positive feelings from doing meaningful work. 
- What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
  - Traditional solutions include community centers within the user's local area. This can range from govenmental centers, university clubs, religious centers, and more.
  - Another traditional solution includes social media groups which connect people among a common interest. For example, [Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/SEELAOrg/) within local communities which share resources and connect people to get sustainable projects done.
- What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
  - Limitations of community centers include a lack of resources or experts who are deeply familiar with sustainability causes. Additionally, users might not be connected to a religious group or university in their area which might connect them with projects related to volunteerism. 
  - Limitations within social media groups, such as Facebook, are that these groups only restricts users to members of the platform. So if a user does not have a Facebook or is not active on their account, then they won't have access to these groups. There are also limitations to privacy. If a user wants to explore resources within a group they are agreeing to share their name and profile with members of the group, no matter how big or small.

### Step 2 Target users
- What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
   - Demographics: Young Adults aged 25-35
   - Preferences: Users who are passionate about sustainaibility/ the environment. Users who have time in their schedule to volunteer for projects
   - Expertise: Users would not require any level of expertise
- In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
   - Users could search for sustainable activities/ programs to be a part of from anywhere, whether it be at home or outside as long as they have their device handy. 
   - Users might want to find resources for sustainability anywhere. For example, a user who cares about sustainability might resort to a google search when looking up what type of bin to throw their trash away while outside. Being able to open up an app dedicated to sustainability that offers quick solutions to these questions rather than endless scrolling would be beneficial to the user.
- What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
   - The goal would be for users to be able to find social sustainable projects to be a part of and how to sign up for these programs. The website wouldn't necessarily track if users actually ended up volunteering for a program/ at a site, but would be used as more of a space to find resources and ways to get involved.
