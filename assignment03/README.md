## Assignment 03
### Step 1 Specify the research goal & requirements 
- What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
   - The main activity this project would support would be connecting users with sustainability projects in their local area so they can help out with a cause they support.
- What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
  - This activity fills the need for wanting to develop the community for the user. It also feels the need of satisfaction from volunteering or giving back to their community. Users are able to feel a sense of an accomplishment and overlal positive feelings from doing meaningful work. 
- What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
  - Traditional solutions include community centers within the user's local area. This can range from govenmental centers, university clubs, religious centers, and more.
  - Another traditional solution includes social media groups which connect people among a common interest. For example, (Facebook groups) [https://www.facebook.com/SEELAOrg/] within local communities which share resources and connect people to get sustainable projects done.
- What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
  - Limitations of community centers include a lack of resources or experts who are deeply familiar with sustainability causes. Additionally, users might not be connected to a religious group or university in their area which might connect them with projects related to volunteerism. 
  - Limitations within social media groups, such as Facebook, are that these groups only restricts users to members of the platform. So if a user does not have a Facebook or is not active on their account, then they won't have access to these groups. There are also limitations to privacy. If a user wants to explore resources within a group they are agreeing to share their name and profile with members of the group, no matter how big or small.

### Step 2 Target users
- What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
- In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
- What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
