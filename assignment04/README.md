Simon's Journey Map:
Why: Simon is a high school science teacher. One of the courses that he teaches is environmental science, which he majored in and his very passionate about. He has a very busy life and is focused on starting a family as he is in his early thirties. However, he wants to be more active in the local community and use his in-depth knowledge to give back in a way other than through teaching.
How: To look for active community sites, Simon logs on to his desktop computer and searches for www.sustain.org. He is familiar with the non-profit and begins his search for places he can get involved in the bay area, where he currently resides. Simon hovers over "Programs" which provides a drop-down menu to the different regions the non-profit is active in. Simon clicks "United States". Simon scrolls down to see that there are 700 communities where the Institute of Sustainable Communities is currently active again. This gets Simon excited that there might be some active in his area. This excitement soon turns to frustration
