## Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
### Overview
#### Summary
This prototype is a redesign of the Institute for Sustainabile Communities' mobile site, specifically it's resources and community involvement pages. This prototype attemps to make the site more usable for peopel who want to be both passively and actively involved with sustainable practices. 

#### Process
I based this high-fidelity prototype on previous low-fidelity sketches of the organization's desktop site. For this prorotype, I used Figma. I then continued on to coduct cognitive walkthroughs with peer and usability tests. From there, I created a revised high-fidelity protoype based on my findings. 

#### Purpose
THe purpose of this interactive prototype is to test the interface of the mobile redesign in relation to the ten usability heuristics. For this iteration, I based my design loosely on my lo-fi screens but because I did a mobile re-design I did accomodate to changes on a smaller screen size.
#### Tasks
1. Filter through specific media items related to sustainability (geared towards passive users).
2. Find contact information for local community efforts (geared towards qctive users).
