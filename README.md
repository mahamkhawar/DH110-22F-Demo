# UX Redesign for Institute for Sutainable Communities
## Maham Khawar- UCLA DH110 Seminar
## Design Challenge

The goal of this project was to make the website for the Institute for Sustainable Communities more usable, following the ten usability heuristics. By making the site more usable, it will be able to cater more fully to the needs of both passive and active members of the sustainable community on a national level.
## Research 

I conducted a heuristic evaluation which can be found [here](https://mahamkhawar.github.io/DH110-22F-MahamKhawar/assignment01/).
I also conducted a usability test [here](https://mahamkhawar.github.io/DH110-22F-MahamKhawar/assignment02/) and a user interview [here](https://mahamkhawar.github.io/DH110-22F-MahamKhawar/assignment03/).
