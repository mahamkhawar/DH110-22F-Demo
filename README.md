# UX Redesign for Institute for Sutainable Communities
## Maham Khawar- UCLA DH110 Seminar: User Experience Design


## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
This project is about doing a re-design of the Institute for Sustainability's website, to make the site more usable in accordance with the ten usablity heuristics. For this redesign, I focused on increasing user control and freedom, felxibility and efficiency, and lastly creating an aesthetic and consistent design throughout all pages. I first completed a heuristic evaluation and conducted usability tests of the currrent site. I then went on to do user research based on someone who fit the demographic of being interested in sustainability and is a young adult between 25 and 35 years old. Based on this user research, I created user persona and scenarios based on the different types of users who would most frequent the site. From there, I moved on to create a low fiedlity prototype based on what users wanted to get out of the site as well as my own experience from the heuristic evaluation and personal navigation of the website. Lastly, I created multiple revisions of a high-fidelity prototype for a mobile version of the website. 


## Design Statement
The goal of this project was to make the website for the Institute for Sustainable Communities more usable, following the ten usability heuristics. By making the site more usable, it will be able to cater more fully to the needs of both passive and active members of the sustainable community on a national level.
